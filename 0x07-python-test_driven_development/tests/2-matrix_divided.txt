How to use 2-matrix_divided.py
==============================
This module defines a matrix division function matrix_divided(matrix, div).

Usage:
======
``matrix_divided(...)``: This returns a new matrix, which is the former matrix divided by div.
The quotients will be rounded to 2d.p
::

    matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided
    >>> matrix = [[3, 6, 9], [12, 15, 18]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    [[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]]

Integers and floats combined.
::

    >>> matrix = [[2, 5, 3], [22, 3.4, 18]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    [[0.67, 1.67, 1.0], [7.33, 1.13, 6.0]]

One row longer than the other.
::
    >>> matrix = [[2, 5, 3, 3], [22, 3.4, 18]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size


::
    >>> matrix = [[2, 5, 3, 3], [22, 3.4, 18, 0]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    [[0.67, 1.67, 1.0, 1.0], [7.33, 1.13, 6.0, 0.0]]

Dividing by zero
::
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 0))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ZeroDivisionError: division by zero


Adding a string to the matrix.
::
    >>> matrix = [[2, 5, 3, "3"], [22, 3.4, 18, 0]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats


Dividing by a string.
::
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    [[0.67, 1.67, 1.0, 1.0], [7.33, 1.13, 6.12, 0.0]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, "12"))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: div must be a number

Dividing an empty matrix
::
    >>> matrix = [[]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    [[]]

Dividing an empty matrix.
::
    >>> matrix = []
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

A one dimensional array
::
    >>> matrix = [2, 45, 32]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats
